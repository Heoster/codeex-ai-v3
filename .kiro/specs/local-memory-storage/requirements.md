# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that the AI model persistently stores chat history and conversational memory in local storage, allowing the AI to maintain context across sessions and provide continuity in conversations. The system should leverage local file-based storage mechanisms to preserve user interactions and AI responses without relying on external databases or cloud services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat history to be saved locally, so that I can resume conversations and the AI remembers our previous interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL store the message in local storage with timestamp and user identifier
2. WHEN the AI responds to a message THEN the system SHALL store the AI response in local storage with timestamp and conversation context
3. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL load previous chat history from local storage
4. WHEN chat history exceeds storage limits THEN the system SHALL implement a retention policy to manage storage size

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to remember context from previous conversations, so that it can provide more relevant and personalized responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL access stored conversation history to maintain context
2. WHEN a user references previous topics THEN the AI SHALL retrieve relevant historical context from local storage
3. WHEN conversation context becomes too large THEN the system SHALL summarize older conversations while preserving key information
4. IF local storage is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and continue with limited context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the memory storage to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can manage storage usage and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL create necessary local storage directories and files if they don't exist
2. WHEN storage reaches a configured threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old conversations based on retention policy
3. WHEN requested by administrator THEN the system SHALL provide tools to backup, restore, or clear stored memory
4. IF storage write operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operating with in-memory storage as fallback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my stored conversations to be secure and private, so that my chat history remains confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing chat history THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive conversation data
2. WHEN accessing stored memory THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions and session authenticity
3. WHEN the application is uninstalled THEN stored conversation data SHALL be securely removable
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the security event
