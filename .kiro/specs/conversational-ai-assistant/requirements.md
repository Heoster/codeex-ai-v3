# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Conversational AI Assistant feature will create a smart, professional AI mind similar to Siri that can engage in natural conversations with users within the CodeEx AI platform. This assistant will provide intelligent responses, help with coding tasks, answer questions, and maintain context throughout conversations while delivering a polished, professional user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using CodeEx AI, I want to interact with an intelligent conversational assistant, so that I can get help with coding tasks and general questions through natural language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the AI assistant THEN the system SHALL process the input and provide a relevant, contextual response within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user asks a coding-related question THEN the system SHALL provide accurate technical guidance with code examples when appropriate
3. WHEN a user engages in conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain a professional, helpful tone throughout the interaction
4. IF the user's request is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to better understand the intent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI assistant to remember our conversation context, so that I can have natural, flowing conversations without repeating information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user references previous parts of the conversation THEN the system SHALL understand and respond appropriately using conversation history
2. WHEN a conversation spans multiple exchanges THEN the system SHALL maintain context for at least 10 previous message pairs
3. WHEN a user starts a new conversation session THEN the system SHALL initialize with a clean context while preserving user preferences
4. IF the conversation context becomes too long THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize and compress older context while retaining key information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI assistant to provide intelligent code assistance, so that I can get help with programming tasks, debugging, and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks for code help THEN the system SHALL analyze the request and provide relevant code examples with explanations
2. WHEN a user shares code for review THEN the system SHALL identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and explain best practices
3. WHEN a user asks about debugging THEN the system SHALL provide systematic debugging approaches and common solution patterns
4. IF the user's code contains syntax errors THEN the system SHALL identify and explain how to fix them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI assistant to have access to relevant knowledge sources, so that it can provide accurate and up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks technical questions THEN the system SHALL access relevant documentation and knowledge bases to provide accurate answers
2. WHEN a user inquires about current technologies or frameworks THEN the system SHALL provide information based on recent and reliable sources
3. WHEN the system is uncertain about information THEN it SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty and suggest where users can find authoritative sources
4. IF a user asks about CodeEx-specific features THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the platform's capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI assistant to handle various types of requests professionally, so that I can rely on it for different kinds of assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a request outside the system's capabilities THEN the system SHALL politely explain limitations and suggest alternatives
2. WHEN a user provides feedback or corrections THEN the system SHALL acknowledge the input gracefully and adjust responses accordingly
3. WHEN multiple users interact with the system THEN each SHALL receive personalized responses appropriate to their context
4. IF a user attempts inappropriate interactions THEN the system SHALL redirect professionally while maintaining helpful engagement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the conversational AI to be performant and reliable, so that users have a smooth experience without delays or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives user input THEN it SHALL respond within 3 seconds under normal load conditions
2. WHEN the system experiences high traffic THEN it SHALL maintain response quality while managing load appropriately
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the AI SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users
4. IF the AI service becomes temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status messages and fallback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI assistant to integrate seamlessly with the existing CodeEx platform, so that I can access it naturally within my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the AI assistant THEN it SHALL be available through the existing CodeEx interface without requiring separate authentication
2. WHEN the AI provides code suggestions THEN users SHALL be able to easily copy, modify, or integrate the suggestions into their projects
3. WHEN the AI references CodeEx features THEN it SHALL provide direct links or navigation paths where applicable
4. IF the user is working on a specific project THEN the AI SHALL have appropriate context about the project when relevant and permitted
