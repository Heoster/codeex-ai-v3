# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical Flask application errors preventing the CODEEX AI application from running properly. The main issues include duplicate route definitions, missing dependencies, and import conflicts that need to be resolved for the application to function correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flask application to start without route conflicts, so that I can run the CODEEX AI application successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN there SHALL be no duplicate route definitions
2. WHEN Flask routes are defined THEN each route SHALL have a unique endpoint name
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN all route decorators SHALL be properly configured

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies to be available, so that the application can import all necessary modules without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all required Python packages SHALL be installed
2. WHEN importing AI modules THEN pandas and other dependencies SHALL be available
3. WHEN the application runs THEN there SHALL be no ModuleNotFoundError exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for missing AI components, so that the application can gracefully degrade when advanced features are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advanced AI modules are unavailable THEN the application SHALL continue running with basic functionality
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN appropriate warning messages SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN AI features fail THEN fallback responses SHALL be provided

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see proper developer attribution for Heoster throughout the application, so that the creator is properly credited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the AI THEN responses SHALL include Heoster developer attribution
2. WHEN viewing the application THEN Heoster branding SHALL be prominently displayed
3. WHEN asking about the developer THEN the AI SHALL provide comprehensive information about Heoster
